# pyDB: A Document Oriented Database written in python for fun
pyDB is a personal project that I am currently developing. I am trying to create a new method for storing data an use it as a source to learn better techniques and practices in software engineering. NOTE: pyDB is not meant to be used in any professional capacity it is quite slow and far from a good option.
